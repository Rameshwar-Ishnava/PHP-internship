					<p>Fundamentally, the Word Press Theme system is a way to “skin” your
							WordPress site. Yet, it is more than just a “skin”. Skinning your site implies
							that only the design is changed. WordPress Themes can provide much
							more control over the visual presentation of your content and other data on
							your WordPress site, as well as behavior of certain site’s elements while
							interacting with visitors.
							How to install Wordpress Theme?
							Before you can vamp up your site with themes, you need to
							install and activate them in your WordPress admin. These are
							the basic steps for most themes:
							Log in to your WordPress admin page, then go
							to Appearance and select Themes.
							To add a theme, click Add New. From this page, you have
							two ways to add a new theme. If you know the name of the
							theme you want, search for it in the Theme directory. If you
							don’t know your preferred theme’s name, use the Feature
							Filter to hone down your selection, check any tags and
							click Apply Filter for a screen filled with themes that meetyour search criteria.
							To unlock a themes options, hover over it; you can either
							choose Preview to see a demo of the theme or install it by
							clicking the Install button once you're ready. Once installed,
							click the Activate link.You're all done, now preview your site
							to see how it looks.</p>
